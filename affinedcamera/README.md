Run this code using `python3`

If everything goes well, you will see a "calibration" window. On this window you must specify 3 points so that they will be stretched out to cover the entire image using a simple affine transform. You can use this script to project a paper or a close-enough whiteboard on your webcam(just select the points carefully).

the points will be considered as Top Left, Top Right, and Bottom Left respectively.

Don't forget to smile in the first window; you might not get the chance on the second one.

cheers.
